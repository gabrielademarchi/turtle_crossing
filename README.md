# Turtle Crossing

In this game we have a bunch of cars going across a busy multi-lane highway and our turtle has to cross the road. 
The player controls the turtle, which can only go forwards, and there's a whole bunch of randomly generated cars which are going horizontally across the screen. One the player reaches the other side of the screen, the cars speed up, but the player goes back to the starting position, ready to cross the screen again.
